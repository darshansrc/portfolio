Hello there! I'm excited to share with you the story of [EzDiagram](https://ezdiagram.com), a project that's very close to my heart. Before we dive in, check out this quick demo video to see EzDiagram in action:

As a developer, I've always been passionate about creating tools that make life easier
for others. That's exactly what led me to build EzDiagram - a SaaS platform that
uses AI to simplify diagram creation.

## The Spark of an Idea

Like many developers, I've spent countless hours creating diagrams for various projects. Whether it was flowcharts, sequence diagrams, or system architectures, I always felt there had to be a simpler way. That's when it hit me - why not combine the power of AI with diagramming tools?

## Building EzDiagram

I started working on [EzDiagram](https://ezdiagram.com) as a side project, dedicating my evenings and weekends to bring this idea to life. Here's a quick overview of how I built it:

1. **Tech Stack**: I chose Next.js 14 as the foundation, paired with React for the frontend. TypeScript was a no-brainer for me - I love the type safety it provides.

2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS was my go-to for quick and consistent styling. It's a real time-saver!

3. **Diagramming Engine**: I integrated Mermaid.js for rendering diagrams. It's powerful and flexible, perfect for what I had in mind.

4. **AI Integration**: This was the exciting part! I used models like GPT-3.5 and Claude to power the AI assistance feature.

5. **User Authentication**: I implemented a robust auth system to ensure user data stays secure.

6. **Database**: For storing user data and diagrams, I set up a reliable database system.

## Features I'm Proud Of

1. **AI-Assisted Diagram Creation**: Users can describe their diagram in plain language, and the AI generates the Mermaid.js code. It's like magic! [Try it here](https://ezdiagram.com/new)

2. **Live Editor**: I built a real-time editor where users can see their diagrams come to life as they code.

3. **Collaboration**: Team features for shared diagram creation and editing. It's great for group projects! [Learn more about our team features](https://ezdiagram.com/teams)

4. **Version History**: Users can track changes and go back to previous versions if needed.

5. **Customization**: I added lots of themes and styling options to make diagrams look awesome.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building [EzDiagram](https://ezdiagram.com) wasn't always smooth sailing. I faced challenges with AI integration, ensuring real-time updates worked flawlessly, and optimizing performance for larger diagrams. But each hurdle taught me something new and made me a better developer.
